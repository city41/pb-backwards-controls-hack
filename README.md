# Puzzle Bobble Guide Dots ROM Hack

A very simple hack for the Neo Geo game Puzzle Bobble. It enables toggling on/off the guide dots by holding down start for two seconds.

This is a companion to my [Neo Geo ROM hacking guide: part 3](https://mattgreer.dev/blog/neo-geo-rom-hacking-guide-part-3/). That guide explains everything that is going on in this repo.
