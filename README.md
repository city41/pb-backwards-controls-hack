# Puzzle Bobble Backwards Controls Hack

A very simple hack for the Neo Geo game Puzzle Bobble. It just flips the inputs, so pressing left goes right, and right goes left. Obviously a very stupid hack. It's only for educational purposes.

This is a companion to my [Neo Geo ROM hacking guide: part 3](https://mattgreer.dev/blog/neo-geo-rom-hacking-guide-part-3/). That guide explains everything that is going on in this repo.
